	SaladoPlayer contains option that fixes problem that occures when panorama is embeded into div of fixed size
	in a html site that is higher than browser window. In such case when moving mouse scroll, it both zooms in/out
	panorama and scrolls browser window. MouseWheelTrap overcomes this Flash Player bug and scrolling zooms in/out ONLY.
