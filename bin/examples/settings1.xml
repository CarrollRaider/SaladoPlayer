<!-- 
	
This is example for most minimalistic working configuration

  - when firstPanorama is not set, SaladoPlayer loads first panorama in configuration
  - trace window will show erros in configuration, in case of any problems check it first 
  - set debug to "false" to hide trace window
  - panorama "id" is mandatory and should be unique among other panorama ids
  - panorama "path" is pointing to *.xml file describing tiled front wall of cube ( _f - front)
  - you can convert panoramas with SaladoConverter, see wiki at http://panozona.com/wiki/
