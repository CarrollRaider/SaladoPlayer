	- both dz_park panoramas are created from cube with side length 1500px
	- plain dz_park was converted with tile size of 375 (375 x 4 = 1500) and it has single tile up to level 9
	- plain dz_park_fast was converted with tile size of 1500 and at all levels it uses single tile 
	- click autorotation button, see that framrate in stats window is higher for dz_park_fast
	- single tile panorama is faster but it loads less fluently, it misses point of Deep Zoom and it should not be used for high resolution panoramas
	- if there are white lines on single tile cube, you can maniupulate overlap attribute in panorama_f.xml file or in settings during conversion
