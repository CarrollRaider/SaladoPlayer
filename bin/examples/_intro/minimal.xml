	Most minimalistic working configuration
	
	- trace window will show erros in configuration, in case of any problems check it first 
	- set debug to "false" to hide trace window
	- panorama id is mandatory and should be unique among other panorama ids
	- panorama path is pointing to *.xml file describing tiled front wall of cube ( name_f - front ect.)
	- you can convert panoramas to format that can be displayed in SaladoPlayer with use of SaladoConverter
